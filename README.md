# Fractals

Fractals are fascinating mathematical objects that exhibit self-similar patterns at different scales. They are created through iterative processes, where a simple geometric shape is repeated recursively, often resulting in complex and intricate structures.

## Characteristics of Fractals

- **Self-Similarity**: Fractals exhibit self-similarity, meaning that parts of the fractal resemble the whole structure. No matter how much you zoom in or out, you'll find similar patterns repeating at different scales.

- **Infinite Complexity**: Despite being generated from simple rules, fractals can exhibit infinite complexity. Even a small change in parameters can lead to vastly different patterns.

- **Fractional Dimension**: Fractals often have a fractional dimension, such as 1.2 or 2.7, indicating they fill more space than a simple geometric shape, yet less than a solid object.

## Examples of Fractals

### 1. Mandelbrot Set

The Mandelbrot Set is one of the most famous fractals, discovered by mathematician Beno√Æt Mandelbrot in 1979. It is generated by iterating a simple equation in the complex plane.

### 2. Koch Snowflake

The Koch Snowflake is a fractal curve that starts with an equilateral triangle and replaces the middle third of each line segment with a smaller equilateral triangle.

### 3. Sierpinski Triangle

The Sierpinski Triangle is a fractal pattern formed by recursively subdividing a triangle into smaller triangles and removing the central triangle at each iteration.

## Applications of Fractals

- **Art**: Fractals have inspired artists for their beauty and complexity. Fractal art often involves generating and manipulating fractal images to create stunning visual patterns.

- **Science**: Fractals are used in various scientific fields such as physics, biology, and geography to model natural phenomena like coastlines, clouds, and tree branches.

- **Technology**: Fractals find applications in signal and image compression, generating realistic terrain for computer graphics, and designing antennas and circuits.

Fractals continue to intrigue mathematicians, scientists, and artists alike, offering endless possibilities for exploration and discovery.
